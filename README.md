This is my MSc in Computer Science Final Project, My Project is about implementing the dynamic graph algorithms and experimenting with various instances and analysing the performance of the software and finally evaluating the complexity of the dynamic graph algorithms. I really enjoyed this project, After resolving many issues in my code, I had developed troubleshooting and debugging skills. I have noticed that my logic building skill has improved and that motivated me to learn more. Now I love to learn and build cool stuff.
